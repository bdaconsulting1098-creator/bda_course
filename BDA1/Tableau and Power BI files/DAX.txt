Top Product by Sales = 
TOPN(1, VALUES(Product[ProductName]), [Total Sales Amount])
Percentage of Sales by Top 5 Products:
Calculate the percentage of sales generated by the top 5 products.



Top 5 Products Sales Percentage = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE([Total Sales Amount], FILTER(ALL(Product), Product[ProductName] IN TOPN(5, VALUES(Product[ProductName]), [Total Sales Amount]))),
    [Total Sales Amount]
)
Sales Variance:
Compare this year's sales to last year's sales.



Sales Variance = 
[Total Sales Amount] - CALCULATE([Total Sales Amount], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Date[Date]))
Count of New Customers:

New Customers = 
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER(
        ALL(Customer[CustomerKey]),
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(Sales, Sales[CustomerKey] = Customer[CustomerKey] && YEAR(Sales[OrderDateKey]) = YEAR(TODAY()))) = 1
    )
)
Product Return Rate:

Product Return Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Sales, Sales[Quantity] < 0)),
    COUNTROWS(Sales)
)
Months with Above Average Sales:
Count the number of months where sales exceeded the average monthly sales.



Months Above Average Sales = 
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER(
        VALUES(Date[Month]),
        CALCULATE([Total Sales Amount], ALL(Date)) > [Average Monthly Sales]
    )
)
Inventory Turnover:

Customer Loyalty Index = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Sales, Sales[OrderQuantity] > 1)),
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[CustomerKey])

Quarterly Growth Rate:
Calculate the growth rate from one quarter to the next.



Quarterly Growth Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]) - CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), DATEADD(Date[Quarter], -1, QUARTER)),
    CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), DATEADD(Date[Quarter], -1, QUARTER))
)
Days to Ship:
Calculate the average number of days taken to ship a product after the order date.



Average Days to Ship = 
AVERAGEX(
    Sales,
    DATEDIFF(Sales[OrderDate], Sales[ShipDate], DAY)
)
